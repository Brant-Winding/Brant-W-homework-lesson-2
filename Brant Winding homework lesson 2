# Challenge (OPTIONAL!): Separating Digits of a Number
# Given the number 1597, your task is to write a Python code
# that separates this number into four variables, each containing
# a digit of the number: 1, 5, 9, and 7. You'll use the
# knowledge of Python operators % and /, variable assignment,
# and working with integers to accomplish this task.

# Tip: To separate the digits of a number, think about how you
# can extract each digit using the remainder (%) and division (/)
# operators. Start by extracting the last digit and then move on
# to the next digits by dividing the number progressively.
# Remember that the remainder when dividing by 10 gives you
# the last digit, and integer division by 10 removes the last digit.
#
# The following code should help you to get an understanding on
# how to get the digits of the number
number = 1597

digit_1 = number % 10
number = number // 10

# print(digit_1) # will print 7
# print(number)  # will print 159

# If you repeat this operation with the second, the third and
# the fourth digits, you will be able to get all the digits.
# Your code here

# Print the result for all four digits
print(digit_1)
print(digit_2)
print(digit_3)
print(digit_4)
